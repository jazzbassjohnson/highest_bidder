The Highest Bidder (Quick Bids)

This is a light weight API for developers interested in the concept of emotionless auctions.  Given a single item, interested bidders pass all of their cards to the dealer so to speak.  When all bidders are collected and the bidder's specifications are in and the auction starts, the winner is presented in a flash.
